| **[Connection approval](basics/connection-approval.md)** | Connection approval allows you to decide, on a per connection basis, whether to allow a connection. You can also use connection approval to specify the player Prefab to create, allowing you to override the default NetworkManager-defined player Prefab on a per player basis. |
| **[Max players](basics/maxnumberplayers.md)** | Netcode for GameObjects provides a way to customize the [connection approval process](basics/connection-approval.md) that can reject incoming connections based on any number of user-specific reasons. |
