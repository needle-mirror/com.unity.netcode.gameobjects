# Netcode for GameObjects

Netcode for GameObjects is a high-level networking library built for Unity for you to abstract networking logic. You can send GameObjects and world data across a networking session to many players at once. With Netcode for GameObjects, you can focus on building your game instead of low-level protocols and networking frameworks.
