| **[Network topologies](terms-concepts/network-topologies.md)** | Network topology defines how a network is arranged. In the context of multiplayer games, this primarily relates to how clients, hosts, and servers are connected and communicate. Different network topologies have different benefits and drawbacks, depending on the type of game you want to make. |
| **[Client-server](terms-concepts/client-server.md)** | Client-server is one possible [network topology](network-topologies.md) you can use for your multiplayer game. |
| **[Listen server host architecture](learn/listenserverhostarchitecture.md)**| A listen server acts as both a server and client on a single player's machine for multiplayer game play. This means one player both plays the game and owns the game world while other players connect to this server. |
