| **[Bitesize use cases](bitesize-usecases.md)** | The [Multiplayer Use Cases Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/MultiplayerUseCases) provides multiple scenes that explain some APIs, systems, and concepts that you can use with Netcode for GameObjects: |
| **[Bitesize introduction](bitesize-introduction.md)** | The Bitesize Samples repository provides a series of sample code as modules to use in your games and better understand Netcode for GameObjects. |
| **[Bitesize space shooter](bitesize-spaceshooter.md)** | Learn more about physics movement and status effects using Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode) NetworkVariables and ObjectPooling. |
| **[Bitesize client driven](bitesize-clientdriven.md)** | Learn more about Client driven movements, networked physics, spawning vs statically placed objects, object reparenting. |
| **[Bitesize dynamic prefabs](bitesize-dynamicPrefabs.md)** | Learn more about the dynamic Prefab system, which allows you to add new spawnable Prefabs at runtime. |
| **[Bitesize social hub](bitesize-socialhub.md)** | The Distributed Authority Social Hub Sample is a project that demonstrates Distributed Authority's features and helps you integrate Distributed Authority into your own game projects. |
