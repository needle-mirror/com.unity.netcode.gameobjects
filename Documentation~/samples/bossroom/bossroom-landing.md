The [Boss Room sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop) is a multiplayer game that demonstrates how to use Netcode for GameObjects to create a networked game. It provides a complete example of how to implement various features such as player movement, combat, and game state management in a multiplayer environment.
