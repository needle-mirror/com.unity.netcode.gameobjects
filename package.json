    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added serializer for `Pose` (#3540)\n- Added mappings between `ClientId` and `TransportId`. (#3515)\n- Added `SinglePlayerTransport` that provides the ability to start as a host for a single player network session. (#3475)\n- When using UnityTransport >=2.4 and Unity >= 6000.1.0a1, SetConnectionData will accept a fully qualified hostname instead of an IP as a connect address on the client side. (#3440)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `NullReferenceException` on `NetworkList` when used without a NetworkManager in scene. (#3502)\n- Fixed inconsistencies in the `OnSceneEvent` callback. (#3487)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkClient` could persist some settings if re-using the same `NetworkManager` instance. (#3494)\n- Fixed issue where a pooled `NetworkObject` was not resetting the internal latest parent property when despawned. (#3494)\n- Fixed issue where the initial client synchronization pre-serialization process was not excluding spawned `NetworkObjects` that already had pending visibility for the client being synchronized. (#3493)\n- Fixed issue where invoking `NetworkObject.NetworkShow` and `NetworkObject.ChangeOwnership` consecutively within the same call stack location could result in an unnecessary change in ownership error message generated on the target client side. (#3493)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkVariable`s on a `NetworkBehaviour` could fail to synchronize changes if one has `NetworkVariableUpdateTraits` set and is dirty but is not ready to send. (#3465)\n- Fixed issue where when a client changes ownership via RPC the `NetworkBehaviour.OnOwnershipChanged` can result in identical previous and current owner identifiers. (#3434)\n\n### Changed"
