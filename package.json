    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added `NetworkVariable.CheckDirtyState` that is to be used in tandem with collections in order to detect whether the collection or an item within the collection has changed. (#3004)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where nested `NetworkTransform` components were not getting updated. (#3016)\n- Fixed issue by adding null checks in `NetworkVariableBase.CanClientRead` and `NetworkVariableBase.CanClientWrite` methods to ensure safe access to `NetworkBehaviour`. (#3012)\n- Fixed issue where `FixedStringSerializer<T>` was using `NetworkVariableSerialization<byte>.AreEqual` to determine if two bytes were equal causes an exception to be thrown due to no byte serializer having been defined. (#3009)\n- Fixed Issue where a state with dual triggers, inbound and outbound, could cause a false layer to layer state transition message to be sent to non-authority `NetworkAnimator` instances and cause a warning message to be logged. (#3008)\n- Fixed issue using collections within `NetworkVariable` where the collection would not detect changes to items or nested items. (#3004)\n- Fixed issue where `List`, `Dictionary`, and `HashSet` collections would not uniquely duplicate nested collections. (#3004)\n- Fixed issue where `NotAuthorityTarget` would include the service observer in the list of targets to send the RPC to as opposed to excluding the service observer as it should. (#3000)\n- Fixed issue where `ProxyRpcTargetGroup` could attempt to send a message if there were no targets to send to. (#3000)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed `NetworkAnimator` to automatically switch to owner authoritative mode when using a distributed authority network topology. (#3021)\n- Changed permissions exception thrown in `NetworkList` to exiting early with a logged error that is now a unified permissions message within `NetworkVariableBase`. (#3004)\n- Changed permissions exception thrown in `NetworkVariable.Value` to exiting early with a logged error that is now a unified permissions message within `NetworkVariableBase`. (#3004)"
