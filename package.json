(#3831)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Ensure logs in `NetworkObject` log the `NetworkObject.name` wherever possible. (#3831)\n- Improved performance of NetworkBehaviour ILPostProcessor by omitting unnecessary type and assembly resolutions. (#3827)\n- Improve performance of `NetworkObject`. (#3820, #3831)\n- If the Unity Transport Disconnect Timeout is set to 0 in the Editor, the timeout will be entirely disabled. (#3810)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Duplicate transport connection events for the same connection will now do nothing. (#3863)\n- Fixed memory leak in `NetworkAnimator` on clients where `RpcTarget` groups were not being properly disposed due to incorrect type casting of `ProxyRpcTargetGroup` to `RpcTargetGroup`.\n- Fixed issue when using a client-server topology where a `NetworkList` with owner write permissions was resetting sent time and dirty flags after having been spawned on owning clients that were not the spawn authority. (#3850)\n- Fixed an integer overflow that occurred when configuring a large disconnect timeout with Unity Transport. (#3810)"
