    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added tooltips for all of the `NetworkObject` component's properties. (#3052)\n- Added message size validation to named and unnamed message sending functions for better error messages. (#3049)\n- Added \"Check for NetworkObject Component\" property to the Multiplayer->Netcode for GameObjects project settings. When disabled, this will bypass the in-editor `NetworkObject` check on `NetworkBehaviour` components. (#3031)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.SwitchTransformSpaceWhenParented` property that, when enabled, will handle the world to local, local to world, and local to local transform space transitions when interpolation is enabled. (#3013)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.TickSyncChildren` that, when enabled, will tick synchronize nested and/or child `NetworkTransform` components to eliminate any potential visual jittering that could occur if the `NetworkTransform` instances get into a state where their state updates are landing on different network ticks. (#3013)\n- Added `NetworkObject.AllowOwnerToParent` property to provide the ability to allow clients to parent owned objects when running in a client-server network topology. (#3013)\n- Added `NetworkObject.SyncOwnerTransformWhenParented` property to provide a way to disable applying the server's transform information in the parenting message on the client owner instance which can be useful for owner authoritative motion models. (#3013)\n- Added `NetcodeEditorBase` editor helper class to provide easier modification and extension of the SDK's components. (#3013)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` would send updates to non-observer clients. (#3057)\n- Fixed issue where an exception could occur when receiving a universal RPC for a `NetworkObject` that has been despawned. (#3052)\n- Fixed issue where a NetworkObject hidden from a client that is then promoted to be session owner was not being synchronized with newly joining clients.(#3051)\n- Fixed issue where clients could have a wrong time delta on `NetworkVariableBase` which could prevent from sending delta state updates. (#3045)\n- Fixed issue where setting a prefab hash value during connection approval but not having a player prefab assigned could cause an exception when spawning a player. (#3042)\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkSpawnManager.HandleNetworkObjectShow` could throw an exception if one of the `NetworkObject` components to show was destroyed during the same frame. (#3030)\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkManagerHelper` was continuing to check for hierarchy changes when in play mode. (#3026)\n- Fixed issue with newly/late joined clients and `NetworkTransform` synchronization of parented `NetworkObject` instances. (#3013)\n- Fixed issue with smooth transitions between transform spaces when interpolation is enabled (requires `NetworkTransform.SwitchTransformSpaceWhenParented` to be enabled). (#3013)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor` now uses `NetworkTransform` as the base type class to assure it doesn't display a foldout group when using the base `NetworkTransform` component class. (#3052)\n- Changed `NetworkAnimator.Awake` is now a protected virtual method. (#3052)\n- Changed  when invoking `NetworkManager.ConnectionManager.DisconnectClient` during a distributed authority session a more appropriate message is logged. (#3052)\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor` so it now derives from `NetcodeEditorBase`. (#3013)\n- Changed `NetworkRigidbodyBaseEditor` so it now derives from `NetcodeEditorBase`. (#3013)\n- Changed `NetworkManagerEditor` so it now derives from `NetcodeEditorBase`. (#3013)"
