(#3601)\n- Fixed issue with allocation to the heap in NetworkBehaviourUpdate when there is nothing to be updated. (#3568)\n- Fixed issue where NetworkConfig.ConnectionData could cause the ConnectionRequestMessage to exceed the transport's MTU size and would result in a buffer overflow error. (#3565)"
