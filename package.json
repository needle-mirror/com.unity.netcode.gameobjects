(#3473)\n- When using UnityTransport >=2.4 and Unity >= 6000.1.0a1, SetConnectionData will accept a fully qualified hostname instead of an IP as a connect address on the client side. (#3441)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkObject.DontDestroyWithOwner` was not being honored. (#3477)\n- Fixed issue where non-authority `NetworkTransform` instances would not allow non-synchronized axis values to be updated locally. (#3471)\n- Fixed issue where invoking `NetworkObject.NetworkShow` and `NetworkObject.ChangeOwnership` consecutively within the same call stack location could result in an unnecessary change in ownership error message generated on the target client side. (#3468)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkVariable`s on a `NetworkBehaviour` could fail to synchronize changes if one has `NetworkVariableUpdateTraits` set and is dirty but is not ready to send. (#3466)\n- Fixed issue with the Distributed Authority connection sequence with scene management enabled where the `ClientConnected` event was fired before the client was synchronized. (#3459)\n- Fixed inconsistencies in the `OnSceneEvent` callback. (#3458)\n- Fixed issues with the `NetworkBehaviour` and `NetworkVariable` length safety checks. (#3405)\n- Fixed memory leaks when domain reload is disabled. (#3427)\n- Fixed issue where disabling the physics or physics2D package modules could result in a compilation error. (#3422)\n- Fixed an exception being thrown when unregistering a custom message handler from within the registered callback. (#3417)\n\n### Changed"
