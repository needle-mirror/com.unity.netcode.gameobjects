    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added event `NetworkManager.OnSessionOwnerPromoted` that is invoked when a new session owner promotion occurs. (#2948)\n- Added `NetworkRigidBodyBase.GetLinearVelocity` and `NetworkRigidBodyBase.SetLinearVelocity` convenience/helper methods. (#2948)\n- Added `NetworkRigidBodyBase.GetAngularVelocity` and `NetworkRigidBodyBase.SetAngularVelocity` convenience/helper methods. (#2948)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue when `NetworkTransform` half float precision is enabled and ownership changes the current base position was not being synchronized. (#2948)\n- Fixed issue where `OnClientConnected` not being invoked on the session owner when connecting to a new distributed authority session. (#2948)\n- Fixed issue where Rigidbody micro-motion (i.e. relatively small velocities) would result in non-authority instances slightly stuttering as the body would come to a rest (i.e. no motion). Now, the threshold value can increase at higher velocities and can decrease slightly below the provided threshold to account for this. (#2948)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed the client's owned objects is now returned (`NetworkClient` and `NetworkSpawnManager`) as an array as opposed to a list for performance purposes. (#2948)\n- Changed `NetworkTransfrom.TryCommitTransformToServer` to be internal as it will be removed by the final 2.0.0 release. (#2948)\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor.OnEnable` to a virtual method to be able to customize a `NetworkTransform` derived class by creating a derived editor control from `NetworkTransformEditor`. (#2948)"
